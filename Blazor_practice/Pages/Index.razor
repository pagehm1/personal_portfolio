<h4 class="text-box">About Me</h4>
<p class="paragraph">
    I am a backend software developer that has been in the industry for two years. In this time I have developed and 
    maintained RESTful APIs, Command Line Interfaces, and in-house libraries using .NET and GOLANG. In my spare time, I like to work on my own projects, 
    both old and new. I like to dive into new frameworks and languages such as GOLANG and Blazor. I also like to code in C and study lower-level
    concepts such as OS development.

<h4 class="text-box">Future Plans</h4>
<p class="paragraph">
   Currently I have been developing in .NET through this project and a couple other projects such as my file_transfer CLI. In the future I plan 
   to add some REST API functionality to this website to display the capabilities of Blazor. I also plan to develop a debugger for the fictional 
   assembly language, pep9. It's an attempt to understand low-level programming better and to become more familiar with the C programming language.
   Other plans in the future include OS development, more .NET projects, and honestly whatever else peaks my interest. There are links below to 
   contact me with any questions or suggestions, as I am open to any. Hopefully this website gives a decent idea at the developer I currently am and
   plan to be in the future. Thank you for taking the time to look me up!
